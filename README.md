# Screech!! (aka a mini GraphQL Demo)

This is a tiny little project demonstrating how GraphQL works with gqlgengo. If you do want to play with this here is a quick way to get started:

- edit `graph/*.graphqls` to change the types
- run `make generate` to regenerate the resolvers
- ???? 
- `http://localhost:8000/` will have the playground, go play!

Any questions, ping me!
